<h1 align="center" id="title">React Where's Waldo Game</h1>

<p id="description">This project was made as the backend part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. This project's main goal was to replicate a "Where's Waldo" game incorporating some kind of backend database. In this game players have to find five different characters spread across a huge image. When the player finds some character location they click on its position and select the correct character from a list. If the coordinates chosen are correct that character is then marked as found. Firebase was used to store character's data and high scores information. This project was made using React, TailwindCSS and Firebase.</p>
